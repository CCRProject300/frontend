--Project idea.
Idea is solid and definitely has the potential to be a great project. However after researching yummly api it seems rather pricey? Unless 
you are going to use various other emails to keep refreshing your api's free 14 day trial.

--User Interface
Your UI is very well designed and thought out. Maybe instead of having nothing else in the login page perhaps you could have a few recipes 
but with limited information on them and this would intrigue people to click on them and then redirect them to a login screen.

--Component Tree Diagram
Component Tree Diagram is very good with no real visible flaws in my opinion.

--Architecture Diagram
Architecture diagram is well laid out and paints a clear picture of the exchange of information
in the project.

--Database Diagram
Very well laid out database diagram with no real complaints on my end.

--Project Idea
Idea is good, would registered users have to pay the monthly fee or could registered users just opt into paying the fee by subscribing?
Personally I wouldn't want to pay just to join a website especially if I would have to just pay again when attending training sessions.
The perks of registering too don't really outweigh the fact you'd have to pay, I'd be spending money to get notifications about the 
option to spend more money. Gallery is a good idea as it will allow users to see more about what they're getting into. Maybe add 
functionality for an admin to create events for members only and have the members sign up for the event through the website?

--User Interface
User interface is okay apart from a few allignment issues, maybe put the class times in a seperated secgtion so they are easier to see?
Also the buttons for "sign up" and "join" do they preform seperate functions?

--Component Tree Diagram
Diagram contains far too much information, it's only meant to contain components and how they are laid out. You have that done here, but
got carried away a bit, for instance Product name, price, image and description are properties of the Product component not individual 
components

--Architecture Diagram
Architecture diagram is well done, maybe however instead of the website being hosted on the virtual desktops at the it you could host it
on the google cloud? Also is there any api's you are going to be using that are pre-existing or are you making your own.

--Database Diagram
Database diagram is well laid out and displays information on the data used in the project adequately.
